Job transition is no fun - ever! However, it does force one to re-evaluate priorities and refocus. After all, this has thrown you out of your comfort zone and (mundane?) routine.

### Job transition resources

- If you are lucky, your previous employer "sponsors" you to a company that specializes in assisting you with your job transition. The sponsorship duration varies from a couple of months to six months or more. This company provides personal coaching, several online resources for training, company lists, templates for various activities/artifacts - such as resumes, marketing document. Training includes some very useful webinars and in-person sessions on networking skills, enterpreneurship options, LinkedIn profiles, resume-building etc. You get a community of other folks in transition, and you get comfort and encouragement as a result, and your network multiplies.
- Church-based Career networks. Some of them are quite active and provide networking and training opportunities very similar to the career transition companies.
- Being in a technology field, I am listing the following resources

  - Udemy
  - [O'Reilly Online](https://learning.oreilly.com/home/). Gives you access to many of their excellent books, and online courses. I joined ACM, and as part of their subscription, you get access to O'Reilly
