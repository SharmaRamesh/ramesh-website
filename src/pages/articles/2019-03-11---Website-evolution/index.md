Over the past couple of weeks I have been re-learning React, and looking for ways to put my learnings around node.js, React, GraphQL and AWS to some practical use. What better than a vanity project - my own personal website!

I have really come to enjoy working with node.js and the entire ecosystem around it. With so much focus on making Javascript more palatable for OOP purists, the tools and IDEs around Javascript have really come a long way!

My goal was to start with a minimalist site and add more capabilities along the way. The [gatsby-starter-lumen](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/starters/alxshelepenok/gatsby-starter-lumen/) starter fit the bill nicely.

Here are some of the tools and technologies I used/copied/borrowed to create my blog-site - in no specific order.

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- [Gatsby.js](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/)
- [React](https://reactjs.org/)
- [Github](https://github.com/)
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- [Amazon S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/)
- [Amazon Route 53](https://aws.amazon.com/route53/)
- [Amazon CloudFront](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/)
- [AWS Certificate Manager](https://aws.amazon.com/certificate-manager/)
- [gatsby-starter-lumen](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/starters/alxshelepenok/gatsby-starter-lumen/)
- [Featured Blog Images in Gatsby.js](https://codebushi.com/gatsby-featured-images/)
- [An Introduction to Using Gatsby Image & Gatsby.js V2](https://codebushi.com/using-gatsby-image/)
- [Unsplash - photos for everyone](https://unsplash.com/) - great site to get and contribute high quality copyright- free images!
- [Markdown Cheatsheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet)
- [Enable HTTPS with Amazon Web Services Certificate Manager, CloudFront and S3](https://webinista.com/updates/enable-https-cloudfront-certificate-manager-s3/)

I hope to continue developing this site and updating with more details!
